                    defines <span class="bold">two types of entity managers.</span> They are :

                <p class="description-paragraph">
                    <span class="bold"> Application-Managed </span>: Application Managed entity manager means 
                    "Entity Managers are created and managed by merely the application ( i.e. our code )" .
                
                <p class="description-paragraph">
                    <span class="bold"> Container Managed </span>: Container Managed entity manager means 
                    "Entity Managers are created and managed by merely the J2EE container 
                    ( i.e. our code doesn't directly manages instead entity managers are created 
                    and managed by container , and our code gets EM's through some way like using JNDI ).

                    A Big Note : For spring based applications, the difference is not much. 
                    Spring only plays roles ( as container if you configure LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean 
                    and as application if you configure LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean)
