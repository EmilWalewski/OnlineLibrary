                <p class="description-paragraph">Basically <span class="bold">JPA specification</span> 
                    defines <span class="bold">two types of entity managers.</span> They are :

                <p class="description-paragraph">
                    <span class="bold"> Application-Managed </span>: Application Managed entity manager means 
                    "Entity Managers are created and managed by merely the application ( i.e. our code )" .
                </p>

                <p class="description-paragraph italic">
                    Note : Created and Managed (above) means "opening ,
                     closing and involving entity manager in transactions"

                <p class="description-paragraph">
                    <span class="bold"> Entity managers are created when an application directly requests one from an entity manager factory. With application-managed entity managers, the application is responsible for opening or closing entity managers and involving the entity manager in transactions.</span> This type of entity manager is most appropriate for use in standalone applications that don’t run in a Java EE container.

                <p class="description-paragraph">
                    <span class="bold"> Container Managed </span>: Container Managed entity manager means 
                    "Entity Managers are created and managed by merely the J2EE container 
                    ( i.e. our code doesn't directly manages instead entity managers are created 
                    and managed by container , and our code gets EM's through some way like using JNDI ).

                <p class="description-paragraph">
                    Entity managers are created and managed by a Java EE container. <span class="bold"> The application doesn’t interact with the entity manager factory at all. Instead, entity managers are obtained directly through injection or from JNDI. The container is responsible for configuring the entity manager factories. </span>This type of entity manager is most appropriate for use by a Java EE container that wants to maintain some control over JPA configuration beyond what’s specified in persistence.xml.

                    A Big Note : For spring based applications, the difference is not much. 
                    Spring only plays roles ( as container if you configure LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean 
                    and as application if you configure LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean)
